        <p><p>This semester we started a project in a completely different direction than what we’ve taken before. Over the course of the past few years, the Makers Club and Robotics team at Lovett have been extremely successful in garnering interest in STEM. We have members who are athletes, actors, musicians, etc. who’ve found some sort of interest in engineering even if they only have time to contribute a little each week. At the same time, we have more and more people drop by just to see what’s going on. We get to hear what a lot of people think about us, and lately we’ve been hearing some patterns.</p>

        <p><p>Starting off the school year with the launch of LunarHab helped carry over last year’s enthusiasm for STEM projects into the new wave of underclassmen. The Makers Club has grown in size and scope, as it now includes members from each grade level in the Upper School. Seeing this new popularity, it is clear that thorough planning and leadership is integral to the future success of the club and effectiveness of project-centered STEM education.</p>

        <p><p>For the sake of saving time and resources in addition to the fact that we were very busy over the summer, we decided to drop our plans for the HAB-4 launch plans and instead invest our time preparing for LunarHAB, which we’ll conduct on September 27th (and recover the morning of September 28th). While we realize that this means we won’t have a practice launch, we believe that devoting more time to LunarHAB will make for better results. From here on out, HAB-4 means the same thing as LunarHAB, and HAB-5 will be a separate project later this year.</p>

        <h4><em>By Nick Becker</em></h4>
        <p><p>After HAB-1, which followed on the heels of a lunar eclipse in October, Josh proposed that we should launch a balloon during one of these extraordinary events. It turns out that the next lunar eclipse will be occurring on September 28th of this year. As a way to prepare for this huge project (HAB-5), we’re dedicating our next balloon, HAB-4, to testing out a payload similar to that of which we will fly during the eclipse. In many ways, HAB-4 will be the most important balloon we will launch in 2015. The summer provides incredible opportunity to develop our skills in electronics and photography, and also plenty of time to build and fine-tune a payload. Currently, we have more improvements planned for HAB-4 than any other balloon before it.</p>

        <p><p>HAB-3 represents every test, improvement, and lesson learned throughout the year in the Lovett Makers Club. In the Fall, we launched our first high altitude balloon with a very simple payload to challenge the idea that we can send something to the stratosphere and then retrieve it. Not only have we successfully recovered every payload to date, but each HAB has pushed the limits of what we thought we were capable of achieving. The following is a look into the process and design behind the HAB-3 payload, and most importantly, what we learned from it.</p>

        <p><p>We’ve finalized our plans to launch at Lake Allatoona this coming Saturday. Fortunately, Bo knows the director of Camp High Harbor, which actually has a campus directly across from the boat ramp that we’re using. They’ve agreed to let us borrow a few of their canoes for the morning, so Bo and I will be in his boat (essentially a canoe with a motor) and we can tug a few other boats with photographers to the area where we’ll launch. We will inflate the balloon in a clear area by the boat ramp to avoid having to do this while on the water, and then take the inflated balloon out onto the lake.</p>

These past weeks we’ve made decisions regarding what changes need to be made before launch and have started work on finalizing HAB-3 for launch day.</p>

While HAB-2 was in many ways a success, there are several areas we plan to improve for this next balloon. To accomplish these tasks in our short three-week preparation period, we have split into groups to increase the efficiency of our work flow and accomplish everything we need to before launch day. Current members of the Makers Club who are participating in GSBC are split into the following groups: launch planning, data collection, structure, power system, or telecommunications.</p>

        <p><p>Before the launch of HAB-2, we decided the team that would chase and recover the balloon. The team consisted of Josh Eiland, Ethan Goldfarb, Anthony Romaniello, Davis Rackley, and Bo Sinkler along with our beloved faculty sponsor, Mr. Karl Hwang, and a very enthusiastic and helpful parent, Mr. Gene Rackley. The chase team left the launch site shortly after launching the balloon (as well as performing two test launches for our TARC rocket) and headed on our way in the direction we knew the balloon was traveling - eastward towards the Georgia-South Carolina line. Similar to our last chase, we were primarily tracking the balloon via the onboard SPOT GPS. We also monitored HAB-2’s APRS packets, which were sent out more frequently.</p>

        <p><p>In preparing for launch day, we had a lot on the schedule. In order to make the balloon launch-ready, we needed to essentially prep everything except the launch site itself. So we put a small piece of PVC in the balloon’s neck, and zip-tied the tops of rope knots down on top of it. This enabled us to be able to attach safety lines to the balloon during inflation and to attach the payload train to the balloon’s neck before inflation began. We then attached lines from the payload to both loops, so that if one somehow came undone the other would salvage the connection.</p>
